# EU VAT Rates for Digital Goods

A simple way to grab VAT rates for Digital Goods for all EU Member States in JSON format. Ideal for syncing with WooCommerce.

Or simply import the tax rates via the CSV file.

The rates are from [http://ec.europa.eu](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf)

Member states can be identified through their ISO_3166-1 country code, and rates for both ebooks and other digital goods are included.

## Maintenance
I will do my best to check every now and then for any changes with the tax rates and update according to the PDF linked above.

## Contributing

You can if you wish contribute should I have not updated the rates when an update is required, simply fork this repo, update the rates.json file and submit a pull request. Working together we should be able to keep this resource up to date.
